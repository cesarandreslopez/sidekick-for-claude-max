# Sidekick for Max

Your Claude Max, working harder: completions, transforms, commits, code review, session monitoring, and more.

![Sidekick demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/main/assets/all_features.gif?v=4)

**Claude Code is incredible for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic workflows.** But sometimes you just want a quick inline completion while typing, or to transform a snippet of code without spinning up a full conversation. And you shouldn't have to pay for yet another subscription to get that.

If you're already paying for Claude Max, Sidekick lets you use those tokens for inline completions, code transforms, AI commit messages, and real-time session monitoring--no extra cost, no separate account.

## Why Am I Building This?

Claude Code and other AI agents have transformed how we build software. But some of us are still **control freaks** who want to *see*, *review*, and *understand* everything that our overly-enthusiastic robot assistant does with our code. We also enjoy writing actual code ourselves sometimes.

Sidekick gives you visibility into what Claude is doing and quick AI assistance for the small stuff—all without leaving VS Code.

## Why Use This Extension?

**Stop paying twice for AI coding tools.**

You're already spending $100-200/month on Claude Max. Sidekick lets you drop your Copilot subscription and get completions, transforms, and session monitoring from the same plan:

| Without This Extension | With This Extension |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Pay $100-200/mo for Claude Max | Same subscription |
| Pay $10-19/mo extra for Copilot | No additional cost |
| No visibility into token usage | Real-time monitoring dashboard |
| Blind to what Claude is doing | Activity timeline, cost tracking, mind map |

**Designed to complement Claude Code CLI, not replace it:**
- Use **Claude Code CLI** for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic tasks
- Use **Sidekick** for fast inline completions, quick code transforms, and monitoring your CLI sessions
- **Session Monitor** shows token usage, costs, activity timeline, and exactly what Claude is doing—essential for understanding where your quota goes, especially if you're hitting limits

The extension uses the fastest available model by default for inline completions—fast, responsive, and lightweight enough that they won't meaningfully impact your quota.

## Prerequisites

At least one of the following:

- **Claude Max subscription** (Recommended) — uses Claude Code CLI, no extra API cost
- **Anthropic API key** — direct API access, per-token billing
- **OpenCode** — uses your configured OpenCode provider/model
- **Codex CLI** — uses OpenAI API

> **Why Claude Max is recommended:** Inline completions fire frequently as you type. With an API key, these per-token costs add up quickly. With Max ($100-200/month), completions are covered by your existing plan—no surprise bills.

## Installation

### For Claude Max Subscribers (Recommended)

1. Install and authenticate Claude Code CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   claude auth
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Claude Max subscription.

2. Install the VS Code extension:
   - **VS Code**: Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CesarAndresLopez.sidekick-for-max)
   - **Cursor/VSCodium**: Install from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-max)
   - **Manual**: Download `.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/releases) → Extensions → "Install from VSIX..."

3. Start typing in any file - completions should appear as ghost text

### For API Key Users

1. Install the VS Code extension (same as above)

2. Set your API key:
   - Run "Sidekick: Set API Key" from the Command Palette
   - Enter your Anthropic API key

3. Switch inference provider in settings:
   - Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search for "sidekick.inferenceProvider"
   - Select "claude-api"

### For OpenCode Users

1. Install the VS Code extension (same as above)

2. Install the OpenCode SDK in the extension directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.vscode/extensions/cesarandreslopez.sidekick-for-max-*
   npm install @opencode-ai/sdk
   ```

3. Make sure OpenCode is running (Sidekick connects to the local server on port 4096)

4. Switch inference provider:
   - Open Settings → search "sidekick.inferenceProvider" → select "opencode"
   - Or: click the Sidekick status bar → "Switch Inference Provider" → OpenCode

> **Note:** Model selection is handled by your OpenCode configuration. The tier values (fast/balanced/powerful) are passed as hints, but OpenCode's own model settings take precedence.

### For Codex CLI Users

1. Install the VS Code extension (same as above)

2. Install the Codex SDK in the extension directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.vscode/extensions/cesarandreslopez.sidekick-for-max-*
   npm install @openai/codex-sdk
   ```

3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is available (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY` env var, or `~/.codex/.credentials.json`)

4. Switch inference provider:
   - Open Settings → search "sidekick.inferenceProvider" → select "codex"
   - Or: click the Sidekick status bar → "Switch Inference Provider" → Codex CLI

The monitor automatically discovers Claude Code sessions and updates in real-time. If Claude Code is running in a different directory than your workspace (e.g., a subdirectory), use **Browse Session Folders** to manually select the session folder. Your selection persists across VS Code restarts. Perfect for understanding token usage, tracking costs, and seeing exactly what Claude is doing in your codebase.

## Troubleshooting

### No completions appearing
1. Click status bar → "Test Connection" to verify provider connectivity
2. Click status bar → "View Logs" to check for errors
3. Verify the status bar shows "Sidekick" is enabled

### "Claude Code CLI not found" error (claude-max provider)
- Install the CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Authenticate: `claude auth`
- Verify: `claude --version`
- **If installed via pnpm/yarn/volta:** Set `sidekick.claudePath` in settings to the full path (find it with `which claude` on Linux/Mac or `where claude` on Windows)

### API key issues (claude-api provider)
- Run "Sidekick: Set API Key" to update your key
- Ensure your API key has sufficient credits
- Run "Sidekick: Test Connection" to verify connectivity

### OpenCode connection issues
- Ensure OpenCode is running (`opencode` in a terminal)
- Sidekick connects to `http://127.0.0.1:4096` by default
- The SDK must be installed: `npm install @opencode-ai/sdk` in the extension directory

### Codex connection issues
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY` is set, or `~/.codex/.credentials.json` exists
- The SDK must be installed: `npm install @openai/codex-sdk` in the extension directory

### Rate limited
- Wait a moment and try again
- Consider using the `fast` tier for more frequent completions
- Increase `debounceMs` to reduce request frequency

## Architecture

The extension supports multiple inference providers:
- **Claude Max** (`claude-max`): Uses Claude Agent SDK via the Claude Code CLI — no extra API cost
- **Claude API** (`claude-api`): Uses Anthropic SDK with your API key — per-token billing
- **OpenCode** (`opencode`): Uses `@opencode-ai/sdk` to connect to a local OpenCode server (requires `npm install @opencode-ai/sdk`)
- **Codex** (`codex`): Uses `@openai/codex-sdk` for OpenAI Codex inference (requires `npm install @openai/codex-sdk`)

Provider auto-detection picks the most recently active agent based on filesystem timestamps. Model settings use a tier system (`fast`/`balanced`/`powerful`) that maps to provider-appropriate models automatically.
