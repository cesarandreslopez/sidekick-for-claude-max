# Sidekick Agent Hub

Multi-provider AI coding assistant for VS Code — inline completions, code transforms, commit messages, and agent session monitoring.

![Sidekick demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-agent-hub/main/assets/all_features.gif?v=4)

AI coding agents are powerful, but they run autonomously — tokens burn silently, context fills up without warning, and everything is lost when a session ends. Sidekick gives you real-time visibility into what your agent is doing, AI-powered coding features that eliminate mechanical work, and session intelligence that preserves context across sessions.

### Agent Monitoring

When your AI agent runs autonomously, you need to know what it's doing. Real-time dashboards, visualizations, and alerts keep you in control.

- **[Session Analytics Dashboard](https://cesarandreslopez.github.io/sidekick-agent-hub/features/session-monitor/)** — real-time token usage, costs, context attribution, activity timeline

## Why Sidekick?

**Works with what you already have.** If you're on Claude Max, you're already paying for the AI — Sidekick uses that subscription for inline completions, code transforms, and more. No extra API costs, no separate accounts. It also supports Claude API, OpenCode, and Codex CLI, so you're never locked into one provider.

**See what your agent is doing.** When Claude Code or Codex runs autonomously, tokens burn silently and context fills up without warning. Sidekick's dashboards show real-time token usage, cost breakdowns, and quota projections — so you catch problems before you hit limits.

**Never lose session context.** Long sessions produce valuable context — decisions, progress, architectural choices — that vanishes when the session ends. Session handoff and decision logging preserve that context, so your next session picks up where you left off instead of re-discovering everything.

**Understand how your agent works.** Mind maps, tool inspectors, and conversation viewers let you trace exactly what happened during a session. Useful for debugging sessions that went off track, or learning from ones that went well.

## Why Am I Building This?

AI coding agents are the most transformative tools I've used in my career. They can scaffold entire features, debug problems across files, and handle the mechanical parts of software engineering that used to eat hours of every day.

But they're also opaque. Tokens burn in the background with no visibility. Context fills up silently until your agent starts forgetting things. And when a session ends, everything it learned — your architecture, your conventions, the decisions you made together — is just gone. The next session starts from zero.

That bothers me. I want to see what my agent is doing. I want to review every tool call, understand where my tokens went, and carry context forward instead of losing it. Sidekick exists because I think the people using these agents deserve visibility into how they work — not just the output, but the process.

## Context Management Matters

Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex all share the same limitation: they forget everything between sessions. Context windows are finite, compaction loses detail mid-session, and nothing survives a session boundary. Without deliberate context management, every session re-discovers your project from scratch. Sidekick's session intelligence features bridge that gap. See the [Context Management guide](https://cesarandreslopez.github.io/sidekick-agent-hub/getting-started/context-management/) for the full picture.

## Troubleshooting

**No completions?** Click "Sidekick" in the status bar → "Test Connection" to verify provider connectivity.

**CLI not found?** Set `sidekick.claudePath` to the full path (find with `which claude`).

**OpenCode issues?** Ensure OpenCode is running and listening on port 4096.

**Codex issues?** Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY` is set.
