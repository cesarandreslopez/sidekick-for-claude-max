# Sidekick for Max

Your Claude Max, working harder: completions, transforms, commits, code review, session monitoring, and more.

![Sidekick demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/main/assets/all_features.gif?v=4)

**Claude Code is incredible for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic workflows.** But sometimes you just want a quick inline completion while typing, or to transform a snippet of code without spinning up a full conversation. And you shouldn't have to pay for yet another subscription to get that.

If you're already paying for Claude Max, Sidekick lets you use those tokens for inline completions, code transforms, AI commit messages, speed reading with AI explanations, and real-time session monitoring--no extra cost, no separate account.

## Why Am I Building This?

Claude Code and other AI agents have transformed how we build software. But some of us are still **control freaks** who want to *see*, *review*, and *understand* everything that our overly-enthusiastic robot assistant does with our code. We also enjoy writing actual code ourselves sometimes. And since agents love to be verbose, we need to **ingest their output faster** (hence RSVP speed reading).

Sidekick gives you visibility into what Claude is doing, quick AI assistance for the small stuff, and tools to read faster—all without leaving VS Code.

## Why Use This Extension?

**Stop paying twice for AI coding tools.**

You're already spending $100-200/month on Claude Max. Sidekick lets you drop your Copilot subscription and get completions, transforms, and session monitoring from the same plan:

| Without This Extension | With This Extension |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Pay $100-200/mo for Claude Max | Same subscription |
| Pay $10-19/mo extra for Copilot | No additional cost |
| No visibility into token usage | Real-time monitoring dashboard |
| Blind to what Claude is doing | Activity timeline, cost tracking, mind map |

**Designed to complement Claude Code CLI, not replace it:**
- Use **Claude Code CLI** for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic tasks
- Use **Sidekick** for fast inline completions, quick code transforms, and monitoring your CLI sessions
- **Session Monitor** shows token usage, costs, activity timeline, and exactly what Claude is doing—essential for understanding where your quota goes, especially if you're hitting limits

The extension uses Haiku by default for inline completions—fast, responsive, and lightweight enough that they won't meaningfully impact your Claude Code quota.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Max subscription** (Recommended) OR **Anthropic API key**
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated (for Max subscription mode)

> **Why Max subscription is recommended:** Inline completions fire frequently as you type. With an API key, these per-token costs add up quickly. With Max ($100-200/month), completions are covered by your existing plan—no surprise bills. Haiku-powered completions are lightweight enough that they won't meaningfully impact your Claude Code quota.

## Installation

### For Claude Max Subscribers (Recommended)

1. Install and authenticate Claude Code CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   claude auth
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Claude Max subscription.

2. Install the VS Code extension:
   - **VS Code**: Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CesarAndresLopez.sidekick-for-max)
   - **Cursor/VSCodium**: Install from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-max)
   - **Manual**: Download `.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/releases) → Extensions → "Install from VSIX..."

3. Start typing in any file - completions should appear as ghost text

### For API Key Users

1. Install the VS Code extension (same as above)

2. Set your API key:
   - Run "Sidekick: Set API Key" from the Command Palette
   - Enter your Anthropic API key

3. Change auth mode in settings:
   - Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search for "sidekick.authMode"
   - Select "api-key"

![CLAUDE.md suggestions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/main/assets/suggest_improvements_to_agent_claude_md.gif)

The monitor automatically discovers Claude Code sessions and updates in real-time. If Claude Code is running in a different directory than your workspace (e.g., a subdirectory), use **Browse Session Folders** to manually select the session folder. Your selection persists across VS Code restarts. Perfect for understanding token usage, tracking costs, and seeing exactly what Claude is doing in your codebase.

## Troubleshooting

### No completions appearing
1. Click status bar → "Test Connection" to verify API connectivity
2. Click status bar → "View Logs" to check for errors
3. Verify the status bar shows "Sidekick" is enabled

### "Claude Code CLI not found" error (Max subscription mode)
- Install the CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Authenticate: `claude auth`
- Verify: `claude --version`
- **If installed via pnpm/yarn/volta:** Set `sidekick.claudePath` in settings to the full path (find it with `which claude` on Linux/Mac or `where claude` on Windows)

### API key issues (API key mode)
- Run "Sidekick: Set API Key" to update your key
- Ensure your API key has sufficient credits
- Run "Sidekick: Test Connection" to verify connectivity

### Rate limited
- Wait a moment and try again
- Consider using `haiku` model for more frequent completions
- Increase `debounceMs` to reduce request frequency

## Architecture

The extension uses the Anthropic SDK directly:
- **Max subscription mode**: Uses Claude Agent SDK to leverage your existing CLI authentication
- **API key mode**: Uses Anthropic SDK with your API key

No local server required.
