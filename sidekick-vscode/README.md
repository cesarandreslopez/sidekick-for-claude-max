# Sidekick for Max

AI code completions and transformations powered by your Claude Max subscription.

**Claude Code is incredible for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic workflows.** But sometimes you just want a quick inline completion while typing, or to transform a snippet of code without spinning up a full conversation. And you shouldn't have to pay for yet another subscription to get that.

If you're already paying for Claude Max, Sidekick lets you use those tokens for fast, Copilot-style completions--no extra cost, no separate account.

## Why Use This Extension?

**Maximize your Claude Max subscription value.**

Most Claude Max subscribers don't use their full 5-hour usage allocation. Sidekick helps you get more from what you're already paying for:

| Without This Extension | With This Extension |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Pay $100-200/mo for Claude Max | Same subscription |
| Pay $10-19/mo extra for Copilot | No additional cost |
| Tokens sitting unused between CLI sessions | Continuous inline assistance |

**Designed to complement Claude Code CLI, not replace it:**
- Use **Claude Code CLI** for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic tasks
- Use **Sidekick** for fast inline completions and quick code transforms

The extension uses Haiku by default for inline completions - it's fast, responsive, and uses minimal quota so you still have capacity for your CLI workflows.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Max subscription** (Recommended) OR **Anthropic API key**
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated (for Max subscription mode)

> **Why Max subscription is recommended:** Inline completions fire frequently as you type. With an API key, these per-token costs add up quickly. With Max ($100-200/month), you're already paying for the tokens—Sidekick just helps you use your unused capacity. No surprise bills.

## Installation

### For Claude Max Subscribers (Recommended)

1. Install and authenticate Claude Code CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   claude auth
   ```
   Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Claude Max subscription.

2. Install the VS Code extension:
   - **VS Code**: Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CesarAndresLopez.sidekick-for-max)
   - **Cursor/VSCodium**: Install from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-max)
   - **Manual**: Download `.vsix` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/releases) → Extensions → "Install from VSIX..."

3. Start typing in any file - completions should appear as ghost text

### For API Key Users

1. Install the VS Code extension (same as above)

2. Set your API key:
   - Run "Sidekick: Set API Key" from the Command Palette
   - Enter your Anthropic API key

3. Change auth mode in settings:
   - Open Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search for "sidekick.authMode"
   - Select "api-key"

## Features

2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Cmd+Shift+M on Mac)
3. Enter your instruction (e.g., "Add error handling", "Convert to async/await", "Add TypeScript types")
4. The selection is replaced with the modified code

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `sidekick.authMode` | `max-subscription` | Authentication mode: `max-subscription` or `api-key` |
| `sidekick.enabled` | `true` | Enable inline completions |
| `sidekick.debounceMs` | `1000` | Delay before requesting completion (ms) |
| `sidekick.inlineContextLines` | `30` | Lines of context before/after cursor for inline |
| `sidekick.transformContextLines` | `50` | Lines of context before/after selection for transform |
| `sidekick.multiline` | `false` | Enable multi-line completions (prose files always use multiline) |
| `sidekick.inlineModel` | `haiku` | Model for inline: `haiku`, `sonnet`, or `opus` |
| `sidekick.transformModel` | `opus` | Model for transform: `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku` |
| `sidekick.claudePath` | (empty) | Custom path to Claude CLI (for pnpm/yarn/non-standard installs) |

> **Note:** Prose files (Markdown, plaintext, HTML, XML, LaTeX, etc.) automatically use multiline mode regardless of the setting.

## Troubleshooting

### No completions appearing
1. Click status bar → "Test Connection" to verify API connectivity
2. Click status bar → "View Logs" to check for errors
3. Verify the status bar shows "Sidekick" is enabled

### "Claude Code CLI not found" error (Max subscription mode)
- Install the CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Authenticate: `claude auth`
- Verify: `claude --version`
- **If installed via pnpm/yarn/volta:** Set `sidekick.claudePath` in settings to the full path (find it with `which claude` on Linux/Mac or `where claude` on Windows)

### API key issues (API key mode)
- Run "Sidekick: Set API Key" to update your key
- Ensure your API key has sufficient credits
- Run "Sidekick: Test Connection" to verify connectivity

### Rate limited
- Wait a moment and try again
- Consider using `haiku` model for more frequent completions
- Increase `debounceMs` to reduce request frequency

## Architecture

The extension uses the Anthropic SDK directly:
- **Max subscription mode**: Uses Claude Agent SDK to leverage your existing CLI authentication
- **API key mode**: Uses Anthropic SDK with your API key

No local server required.
