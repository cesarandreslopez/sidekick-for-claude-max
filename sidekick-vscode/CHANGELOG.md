# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sidekick for Max VS Code extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.4] - 2026-02-14

### Improved

- **Collapsible Session Navigator**: The Sessions panel in the dashboard sidebar is now collapsible
  - Click the header to expand/collapse the session list
  - Expanded by default; chevron rotates to indicate state
  - Pin, Refresh, and Browse buttons remain independently clickable

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-10

### Improved

- **Dashboard UX polish**: Improved layout and feedback for the Session Summary and Session tabs
  - Moved "Generate AI Narrative" button to top of Summary tab, immediately after the metrics row, so it's visible without scrolling
  - Added progress notification with time estimate when generating narratives (VS Code notification + inline spinner with "~15-30s" message)
  - Reorganized Session tab from one monolithic "Session Details" section into three thematic groups:
    - **Session Activity** — Activity Timeline, File Changes, Errors
    - **Performance & Cost** — Model Breakdown, Tool Analytics, Tool Efficiency, Cache Effectiveness, Advanced Burn Rate
    - **Tasks & Recovery** — Task Performance, Recovery Patterns
  - Promoted richer panels (Task Performance, Cache, Recovery, etc.) from nested collapsibles to always-visible sections within their group — one click to expand, no double-expand needed

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-07

  - `performNewSessionCheck()` now respects the custom session directory instead of always using the workspace path

## [0.7.8] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Mind Map: Directory & Command Nodes**: Grep/Glob and Bash tool calls now show their targets in the mind map
  - Directory nodes (brown) show paths searched by Grep/Glob tools
  - Command nodes (red) show command types executed by Bash (git, npm, docker, etc.)
  - Tooltips display detailed context:
    - Directory nodes show search patterns used (e.g., `*.ts`, `TODO`)
    - Command nodes show actual commands executed (e.g., `npm install`, `git status`)
  - Node sizes scale with usage frequency
- **Mind Map: Auto-Focus on Activity**: Mind map automatically pans to show new activity
  - Focuses on newly added nodes or the latest tool-to-file/URL connection
  - Preserves user's zoom level while adjusting pan position
  - Smooth easing animation for comfortable viewing

### Fixed

- **Custom folder new session detection**: Browsing to a custom folder now properly detects new sessions when Claude Code starts
  - Previously, discovery polling used the workspace path instead of the custom directory

  - Gracefully hidden when using API key mode or no OAuth token available

## [0.7.5] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- **Subdirectory session discovery**: Session monitoring now finds Claude Code sessions started from subdirectories of the workspace ([#7](https://github.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/issues/7))
  - When VS Code workspace is `/project` but Claude Code starts from `/project/packages/app`, the extension now correctly discovers and monitors that session
  - Uses prefix-based matching with most-recently-active selection when multiple subdirectory sessions exist
  - Prevents false positives (e.g., `/project` won't match `/project-v2`)
  - Added `subdirectoryMatches` and `selectedSubdirectoryMatch` to session diagnostics for debugging
