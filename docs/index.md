## What Sidekick Does For You

**Code faster.** AI handles the mechanical work — boilerplate, commit messages, docs, PR descriptions, error explanations — so you focus on design and logic. Inline completions understand your project context, not just syntax.

**Stay in control.** When AI agents run autonomously, tokens burn silently and context fills up without warning. Sidekick's real-time dashboards, mind maps, and notification triggers give you visibility into what your agent is doing, so you can catch problems before you hit limits.

**Never lose context.** Sessions end and everything is lost — decisions, progress, architectural choices. Session handoff and decision logging preserve that context automatically, so your next session picks up where you left off instead of re-discovering everything.

## Why Am I Building This?

AI coding agents are the most transformative tools I've used in my career. They can scaffold entire features, debug problems across files, and handle the mechanical parts of software engineering that used to eat hours of every day.

But they're also opaque. Tokens burn in the background with no visibility. Context fills up silently until your agent starts forgetting things. And when a session ends, everything it learned — your architecture, your conventions, the decisions you made together — is just gone. The next session starts from zero.

That bothers me. I want to see what my agent is doing. I want to review every tool call, understand where my tokens went, and carry context forward instead of losing it. Sidekick exists because I think the people using these agents deserve visibility into how they work — not just the output, but the process.
