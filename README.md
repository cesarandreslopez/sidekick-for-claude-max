**Claude Code is incredible for complex, multi-file refactoring and agentic workflows.** But sometimes you just want a quick inline completion while typing, or to transform a snippet of code without spinning up a full conversation. And you shouldn't have to pay for yet another subscription to get that.

If you're already paying for Claude Max, Sidekick lets you use those tokens for inline completions, code transforms, AI commit messages, speed reading with AI explanations, and real-time session monitoring—no extra cost, no separate account.

## Why Am I Building This?

Claude Code and other AI agents have transformed how we build software. But some of us are still **control freaks** who want to *see*, *review*, and *understand* everything that our overly-enthusiastic robot assistant does with our code. We also enjoy writing actual code ourselves sometimes. And since agents love to be verbose, we need to **ingest their output faster** (hence RSVP speed reading).

Sidekick gives you visibility into what Claude is doing, quick AI assistance for the small stuff, and tools to read faster—all without leaving VS Code.

## Why Sidekick for Max?

**Stop paying twice for AI coding tools.** You're already spending $100-200/month on Claude Max. Sidekick lets you drop your $10-19/month Copilot subscription and get completions, transforms, and session monitoring from the same plan:

- **Replace GitHub Copilot** - Inline completions powered by Haiku are fast and consume minimal quota, so even heavy Claude Code users can run them freely
- **Monitor your Claude Code sessions** - Real-time dashboard showing token usage, costs, activity timeline, and what Claude is doing in your codebase—especially valuable if you're burning through quota and want to know where it's going
- **No additional cost** - Uses your existing Claude Code CLI authentication
- **Complements Claude Code CLI** - CLI excels at agentic multi-file tasks; Sidekick handles quick inline completions and transforms

## How It Works

The extension uses the Anthropic SDK directly to call Claude. If you have a Claude Max subscription, it leverages the Claude Code CLI authentication - no API keys needed.

- **Max subscription**: Uses `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` via Claude Code CLI auth
- **API key**: Uses `@anthropic-ai/sdk` with your Anthropic API key

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Max subscription** (Recommended) OR Anthropic API key
- Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated (for Max subscription mode)

> **Why Max subscription is recommended:** Inline completions fire frequently as you type. With an API key, these per-token costs add up quickly. With Max ($100-200/month), completions are covered by your existing plan—no surprise bills. Haiku-powered completions are lightweight enough that they won't meaningfully impact your Claude Code quota.

### Setup

![Installation demo](assets/installation.gif?v=3)

1. Install and authenticate Claude Code CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   claude auth
   ```

2. Install the extension:
   - **VS Code**: Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CesarAndresLopez.sidekick-for-max)

3. Start coding - completions appear automatically as you type

## Token Efficiency

| Feature | Default Model | Token Impact |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Inline completions | Haiku | Minimal - fast and cheap |
| Generate documentation | Haiku | Minimal - fast generation |
| Code transforms | Opus | Higher - worth it for quality |
| Quick Ask | Sonnet | Moderate - balanced quality |
| Explain Code | Sonnet | Moderate - on-demand only |
| Error explanations | Sonnet | Moderate - on-demand only |
| Commit messages | Sonnet | Moderate - balanced quality and speed |
| Pre-commit review | Sonnet | Moderate - thorough analysis |
| PR descriptions | Sonnet | Moderate - one-time generation |
| RSVP explanations | Sonnet | Moderate - on-demand only |

This design lets you use inline completions freely throughout the day while preserving quota for heavier CLI workflows, transforms, and commit messages.

## Multiple Windows

Each VS Code window runs its own extension instance with independent caches. This means:

- **No shared cache** - Completions cached in one window aren't available in another
- **Independent requests** - Opening the same file in two windows may trigger duplicate API calls
- **Shared authentication** - All windows use the same Claude Code CLI auth or API key

This is standard VS Code extension behavior. For most workflows it's transparent, but be aware that many simultaneous windows could increase token usage.

## Installing in VS Code Forks

The extension works in Cursor, VSCodium, and other VS Code forks.

### Option 1: Open VSX (Recommended)

Install directly from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-max) - the open marketplace used by Cursor, VSCodium, and other VS Code forks.

### Option 2: Download from GitHub Releases

1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from [Releases](https://github.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max/releases)
2. In your editor: Extensions → `...` menu → "Install from VSIX..."
3. Select the downloaded file

### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cesarandreslopez/sidekick-for-claude-max.git
cd sidekick-for-claude-max/sidekick-vscode
npm install
npm run package
```

Then install the generated `.vsix` file as above.

### Cursor-Specific Notes

Cursor has its own AI features that may conflict with Sidekick completions. To use Sidekick in Cursor:

1. Disable Cursor's built-in completions in Cursor Settings if you prefer Sidekick's
2. Or use both side-by-side (Sidekick uses your Claude Max tokens, Cursor uses its own)
